# Prisma Usage Guide

Prisma is a powerful database toolkit that simplifies database access and management in your application. It provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer, a query builder, and migration tools.

## Schema Definition

Define your data models, relationships, and configurations in the `schema.prisma` file. Example:

```prisma
model User {
  id       Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  username String
  email    String   @unique
  posts    Post[]
}

model Post {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title   String
  content String
  author  User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId Int
}
```

## Database Migration

### Step 1: Apply Migrations

Prototype and push the changes in your `schema.prisma` to the database:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### Step 2: Generate Migration Files (Optional)

After finish prototyping, create migration files for your schema changes, run:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name your-state
```

## Visualize Data with Prisma Studio

Prisma Studio is a visual interface to explore and manage your data. Run the following command to start Prisma Studio:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

## Conclusion

Prisma offers efficient tools to manage your database and interact with it using a powerful query builder. By following this guide, you'll be able to create and maintain your application's database effectively.
