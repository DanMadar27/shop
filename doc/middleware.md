Middleware plays a crucial role in enhancing the functionality and security of your application.
The middleware file, located at `src/middleware.ts`, contains various functions that help manage incoming requests before they reach the main application logic.
This file is a fundamental part of the request-handling process, allowing you to add and customize functionality easily.
